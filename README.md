-about 
    this game is designed for anyone who has had a chance to learn basic arithmetic (multiplication, division, addition, subtr). as soon as we get up in the morning, instead of rushing to check email or our twitter feed that might carry good AND bad news, this game will stimulate the mind and give a sense of accomplishment first thing in the morning which will in return affect the day's remaining tasks (hopefully in the positive direction). the game is meant to become part of a morning routine. the background images will be related to beautiful sceneries around the world - showcasing some sort of beauty nature incessantly offers us throughout the year in every part of the world. the user will have 1 min to finish 10 questions (one minute in an effort to provide some stimulation but avoid adding unnecessary screen time to users that are already bombarded with it); there will be a positive message at the end of the game, reminding the user that the best place on earth currently is equal to the user's location, ending with "good morning!"

-win loss conditions

-a way to keep playing
